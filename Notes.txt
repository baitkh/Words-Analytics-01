project Word Analytics
34.to record the entry of word use an onChange event 
to remove the wrong spell underline use " spellcheck = "False"
and Placeholder for text in the box

35. 
to change the form from uncontrolled to controlled we would useState hook and introduce "value " set to the initiall value 		

36. to show warning make a new component and then use useState hook to track that warning by default set warnings to "false " then setWarning(true)

37. to make the component resuable pass the props to the component and then recieve it 

43. to lift up state move the the things to the parent component like in this case the useState [ text, setText] is moved to container from the "Textarea" component to be
received into the "Stats" component 

44. for number of words use .trim() to remove any spaces,.split(/\s+/) converts that into an array and .filter(word => word !== "") and then
	the filter will filter out the words that are spaces it meanns that will not be counted
45. to clean out the props store that in one object and then pass that object as a prop even you can declare the variable inside that object 
	after that you don't need to declare that varibles outside the object

47. if you are usign constants in your porject later it would b hard to find out where did you use those constants so better is make a separate 
	file for constants with " JS" extension and write the variabe name in upper case and simply export not export default
